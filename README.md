#PerformTrack ML
This is a simple machine learning project that uses various classification algorithms to predict the factors influencing student grades, based on data from a CSV file.

The dataset includes students from various nationalities and grade levels, along with key influencing factors such as:

Number of hands raised

Attendance count

Hours studied, etc.

Multiple machine learning classifiers have been applied to achieve the most accurate predictions of the factors that impact student performance.

Additionally, visual tools such as graphs and confusion matrices are used to represent the results effectively.
